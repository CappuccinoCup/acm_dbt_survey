\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Dynamic binary translation is an area that has been studied for several decades.
It arose from the requirements of binary compatibility and migration and was gradually used in binary analysis, binary security, virtualization, and simulation.
We reviewed existing studies in this area, focusing on various optimizations of DBT, categorizing and illustrating them.
We also introduce various applications of DBT.
At last, we listed the problems that still exist in DBT and analyzed the future development directions.
Given that performance will still be the most important issue in DBT, we also propose a possible methodology for DBT optimization.
